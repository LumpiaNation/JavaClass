Create a class called Vehicle, that has the manufacturer's name(type String),
number of cylinders in the engine (type int), and owner (type Person given next).
Then, create a class called Truck that is derived from Vehicle and has the following additional properties: 
the load capacity in tons(type double since it may contain a fractional part) and towing capacity
in pounds (type int). Be sure your class has a reasonable completement of constructors, accessor and mutator
methods, and suitably define equals and toString methods. Write a programs to test all your methods
The definition of the class Person follows. Completiting the definitions of the methods is 
part of this programming projects.

public class Person
{
   private String name;
   public Person()
   {...}
   public Person(String theName)
   {...}
   public Person(Person theObject)
   {...}
   public String getName()
   {...}
   public void setName(String theName)
   {...}
   public String toString()
   {...}
   public boolean equals(Object other)
   {...}
}
